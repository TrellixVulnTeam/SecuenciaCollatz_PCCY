The Pdfcrowd API lets you easily create PDF from web pages or raw HTML
code in your Python3 applications.


To use the API, you need an account on `pdfcrowd.com
<https://pdfcrowd.com>`_, if you don't have one you can sign up `here
<https://pdfcrowd.com/pricing/api/>`_. This will give you a username
and an API key.


An example::

    import pdfcrowd

    try:
        # create an API client instance
        client = pdfcrowd.Client("username", "apikey")

        # convert a web page and store the generated PDF into a pdf variable
        pdf = client.convertURI('http://example.com')

        # convert an HTML string and save the result to a file
        html="<html><body>In-memory HTML.</body></html>"
        client.convertHtml(html, open('html.pdf', 'wb'))

        # convert an HTML file
        client.convertFile('/path/to/local/file.html', open('file.pdf', 'wb'))

    except pdfcrowd.Error as why:
        print('Failed: {}'.format(why))
